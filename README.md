  - `README.md`: Setup instructions for Cursor
  - `settings.json`: Java development settings for Cursor
  - `launch.json`: Debug configurations
  - `workspace-settings.json`: Project-specific settings

- `cursor-vs-intellij.md`: Comprehensive comparison between Cursor and IntelliJ IDEA

- `bug_analysis/`: Bug analysis tools and reports
  - `bug_finder.py`: Static code analysis tool
  - `bug_analysis_report.md`: Full analysis results
  - `bug_report.md`: Documentation of bugs found and fixes implemented
  - `create_resource_leak_test.py`: Script to create test for resource leak
  - `run_resource_leak_test.py`: Script to verify resource leak issue
  - `fix_resource_leak.py`: Script to fix resource leak

- `benchmarks/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/benchmark/spatial/GeometrySimplificationBenchmark.java`: Fixed file with resource leak patch
- `benchmarks/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/benchmark/spatial/GeometrySimplificationBenchmark.java.bak`: Backup of original file before fix

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Cursor Configuration**: Created configuration files to enable Elasticsearch development in Cursor
2. **IDE Comparison**: Documented differences between Cursor and IntelliJ for Java development
3. **Bug Analysis**: Developed static analysis tool that identified various issues:
   - Resource leaks: 45 instances
   - Null pointer issues: 36 instances
   - Exception handling issues: 730 instances
   - Concurrency issues: 999 instances
   - Infinite loops: 12 instances
4. **Bug Fix**: Fixed resource leak in GeometrySimplificationBenchmark.java using try-with-resources pattern

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone this repository
2. Follow setup instructions in `cursor-setup/README.md` to configure Cursor
3. Review `cursor-vs-intellij.md` to understand differences between the IDEs
4. Examine `bug_report.md` for details on bugs found and fixes implemented

## Bug Fix Details

The main bug fix addresses a resource leak in GeometrySimplificationBenchmark.java where a BufferedReader was created but never properly closed. The fix implements the try-with-resources pattern to ensure proper resource cleanup.
